## Professional Experience

### Dec 2014 - Present 

**Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training**/*Software Engineer, Flight Performance*

* 787 Flight model and trim module development
* Design and development of a custom validation tool for running QTGâ€™s
* On site work at the AeroMexico training facility on the QTG package before qualification
* Stability improvements for the 787 Integrated Panel Trainer

### 2009 - Present

**Delft University of Technology**/*PhD Candidate*

#### Topic
*Risk Perception in Ecological Information Systems through Intentional Constraints*

Past research on ecological displays has mainly focused on visualizing physical constraints. This research aims to also include and visualize procedural and regulatory constraints to ensure operators comply with safety buffers, but are able to disregard them in emergency situations while being aware of physical system limitations. 

#### Projects

* CAMMI (Atemis JU) Design of Cognitive Adaptive Man Machine Interfaces. Technical and administrative lead for the TU Delft contribution to the EFIS domain (3yr)
* Software and hardware support for the on board Flight Test Information System of the Cessna Citation test aircraft operated by the [Control and Simulation Departement of the TU Delft](http://www.cs.lr.tudelft.nl)
